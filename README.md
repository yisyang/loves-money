A domain / email forwarder built on a personal toy framework called CarCrashJS.

While the toy framework supports having multiple subdomains (UI, API) within the same project, the
approach is not recommended in production as it goes against the micro-services approach and makes
designing a self-scaling infrastructure more difficult.
